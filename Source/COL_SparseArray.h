/**
	COLA
	
	concurrently operable lockless sparse array
	small static capacity with limited garbage collection
	
	The primary operations are insert, search for, and remove a value
	associated with a hash.  Additionally there are operations to count or get
	all value associations.  Any operation may be used concurrently from
	multiple threads without locks or other synchronization and will complete
	without locking or waiting.  Deallocation is not protected and depends
	on external safety mechanisms.
	
	Any operation will complete at an arbitrary point in time that is not
	strictly before or after any other operation.  Operations may be truly
	simultaneous.  Retrieving all values sees a snapshot that may not have
	existed at a distinct point in time.
	
	Each instance defines a small addressable space for all nodes that imposes
	a hard limit on the number of leaf and branch nodes available.  There are
	typically three times more branch nodes than leaf nodes but the worst case
	hashes can deplete the branch nodes before reaching the leaf capacity.
	
	Nodes that are removed are not available for insertion until all methods
	that interrupted or were interrupted by removal have completed.  Further
	removes before the first has settled pick up pending branch nodes.  Heavy
	concurrent use can temporarily deplete the node pool and prevent insertion.
	Heavy use varies by architecture but is typically dozens of concurrent
	removals and insertions within a microsecond.
	
	Search and replace never fail.  Remove never fails but does not immediately
	make resources available for insertion.  Insertion may fail if there are
	no nodes available.  Insertions that fail may succeed on a later attempt.
	
	Hashes that vary by only a few grouped bits may let insert and remove be
	more efficient.  Hashes that vary at both the most and least significant
	bits but are identical through the middle are least efficient.
