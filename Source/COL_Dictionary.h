/*
	Callbacks must be able to handle any value that may be passed
	to assign, remove or search.  If NULL may be passed then the
	callbacks must handle NULL.
	
	Keys must be immutable with respect to the hash callback.  If
	the key changes such that it would generate a different hash it
	will equal nothing.  The hash is only calculated when the key is
	assigned.
	
	When retain and release callbacks are provided then all keys
	and values will be held while an association exists and may
	be held for a short time before or after an association exists.
	
	When a retain callback is provided for values
		all assigned values are retained
		all removed values are released
		all results from search, remove and assign are retained
		keys are retained and released when values are replaced
	
	If there is no equality callback then the hash callback will not
	be used.  The hashes of two equal values must be equal.  When the
	hashes of two unequal values are equal it causes a hash collision
	and degrades performance.
	
	Using the COLD_AssignSum option with value callbacks is undefined
